# Internet-of-Things-Hub
My goal  is  to  build  a  smart  hub  for  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  using a full stack web application framework such as spring boot.
IoT hub consists of a frontend web application that enables users to monitor
and control their IoT devices from their phones, pads, or computers, and a server
backend deployed on-premises or in the cloud that talks to the IoT devices. Open
source solutions like Home Assistant exist but we would like to build our own to learn
application software development.
